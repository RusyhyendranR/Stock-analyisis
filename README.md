Stock analysis using power-bi

Opening and Closing Stock Prices

The opening stock prices have shown a consistent increase year over year from 2018 to 2022.
There was a significant jump in opening stock price from 2019 (0.51M) to 2020 (0.83M).
Closing stock prices have mirrored opening prices closely, indicating stability in the stock's annual performance.
There is no change in opening and closing prices for the year 2023, both valued at 0.16M, which suggests this data might be for a part of the year (e.g., a quarter) rather than the full year.

High and Low Stock Point Values
The highest point reached by the stock increased each year, peaking at 0.85M in 2022.
The lowest point, similarly, increased each year up until 2022, suggesting a rising strength in stock value and possibly a bullish market sentiment.
The high and low points for 2023 are equal at 0.16M, which is a significant drop from the previous year and could indicate a major event affecting stock prices. This needs further investigation to understand the context.

Additional Observations
The difference between the high and low points for each year seems to be narrowing over time, which could indicate reduced volatility in the stock.
The year 2023 shows an anomaly with equal opening, closing, high, and low points. This could be due to various reasons such, a stock split, or an external event affecting the market.

Stock Variation by Day

The daily chart shows fluctuations within a range, suggesting typical market volatility.
There seems to be a pattern of rises and drops, but without the context of market events, it's hard to draw conclusions on the causes.
The prices tend to stay above a certain threshold, which could indicate a support level in the stock's price.

Stock Variation by Month

This chart shows a more extended time frame with multiple lines, likely representing different years.
There is a general trend of increases and decreases, but it seems to follow a seasonal pattern, with peaks and troughs occurring around the same months each year.
The end of the year shows an uptick, which could be attributed to year-end financial activities like window dressing.

Stock Variation by Quarter

The quarterly chart indicates a general upward trend in stock prices.
There's a noticeable drop in the second quarter followed by a recovery, which may suggest a cyclical pattern or a response to quarterly financial reports.
The lines for different years follow a similar trajectory, hinting at consistent growth across multiple years.

Stock Variation by Year

The yearly chart exhibits growth from 2018 to 2021.
There is a dramatic drop in 2023, which aligns with the previous chart you shared, where 2023 also showed a significant reduction in stock price.
The sharp decline in 2023 warrants an investigation into market conditions, company performance, or external factors that might have influenced this change.
Overall Insights

The stock shows signs of both short-term volatility and long-term growth, with the latter being interrupted in 2023.
Cyclical patterns suggest that the stock may have predictable seasonal behaviors that could be leveraged for investment strategies.
The significant drop in 2023 is the most notable feature across all charts and should be a focal point for further analysis.
